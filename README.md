# Ludo AI Project

This is a Ludo AI project. It is done as a part of "Tools of Artificial Intelligence" course at the University of Southern Denmark, under the supervision of Poramate Manoonpong. 

## Installation

A Python version newer than 3.8 is recommended. (Preferably Python 3.10)

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also for experiencing the full capabilities of the project, there might be a need to have an NVidia Graphix Card with CUDA compatibility. More details about it can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

```bash
# For starting both the training and the testing after it
cd src
python main.py

```
